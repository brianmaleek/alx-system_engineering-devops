# Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Outage

## Issue Summary:

- ## Duration:

  - Start Time: 2023-11-12 20:23 UTC
  - End Time: 2023-11-12 21:53 UTC

- ## Impact:

  - The incident persisted for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
  - Users faced either complete inaccessibility or degraded performance.
  - Approximately 37% of users encountered disruptions.

- ## Root Cause:

  - The Nginx server startup failure resulted from a misconfiguration in the Nginx configuration file, specifically hindering the location of the index.html file.

## Timeline:

- ### 20:23 UTC:

  - D**etection**: The monitoring system promptly identified the outage, triggering alerts.

- ### 20:25 UTC:

  - **Investigation**: Initial focus on high CPU usage on the database server led to a misleading path, diverting attention from the actual issue.

- ### 20:30 UTC:

  - **Identification**: Engineers pinpointed the root cause as a misconfiguration in the Nginx configuration file.

- ### 20:30 UTC:

  - **Resolution**: Corrective action involved rectifying the Nginx configuration file and initiating a restart of the Nginx server.

- ### 20:45 UTC:

  - **Recovery**: As the Nginx server resumed operation, the service gradually recovered.

- ### 21:53 UTC:

  - **Fully Recovered**: Full restoration of normal functionality signaled the resolution of the incident.

## Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially, the investigation focused on elevated CPU usage on the database server, diverting attention. Subsequent exploration revealed the Nginx server startup failure as the primary cause.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- ### Root Cause:

  - The Nginx configuration file misconfiguration hindered the server's ability to locate the index.html file, preventing successful startup.

- ### Resolution:

  - Engineers promptly addressed the incident by correcting the Nginx configuration file and restarting the Nginx server.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**1. Review Nginx Configuration Files:**

- Conduct thorough and regular reviews of all Nginx configuration files to ensure accuracy.

**2. Automated Tests:**

- Implement automated tests to identify and flag misconfigurations in Nginx configuration files during pre-deployment stages.

**3. Monitoring for Nginx Server Start Process:**

- Enhance monitoring capabilities to specifically track the Nginx server start process, enabling early detection of abnormalities.

**4. Runbook Creation:**

- Develop a comprehensive runbook outlining step-by-step procedures for efficient troubleshooting and incident response related to Nginx server outages.

## Conclusion:

The outage, rooted in a misconfiguration in the Nginx configuration file, was effectively mitigated by correcting the file and restarting the server. To fortify against future incidents, a proactive approach has been adopted, including regular configuration reviews, automated testing, specialized monitoring, and the establishment of a detailed runbook for streamlined incident response.
