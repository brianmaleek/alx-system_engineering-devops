- ### 20:30 UTC:

  - **Identification**: Cue dramatic music! The mischievous Nginx configuration file was revealed as the villain of the hour.

- ### 20:30 UTC:

  - **Resolution**: The engineers, armed with code-wielding keyboards, corrected the Nginx config and hit the "Restart" button like pros.

- ### 20:45 UTC:

  - **Recovery**: The Nginx server, feeling refreshed after its reboot, started serving pages faster than a caffeinated barista.

- ### 21:53 UTC:

  - **Fully Recovered**: The web app rose from the ashes like a phoenix, and users were once again free to surf the digital waves.

## Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially, our engineers were hunting for a CPU-hogging database ghost. Turns out, it was just Nginx flexing its misconfiguration muscles.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

- ### Root Cause:

  - The Nginx configuration file, playing a game of hide-and-seek with index.html, was caught red-handed.

- ### Resolution:

  - Our tech wizards quickly brought peace to the server realm by fixing the Nginx config and giving it a virtual slap on the wrist.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**1. Review Nginx Configuration Files:**

- Engineers donned their detective hats for regular Nginx config file check-ups. No misconfigurations allowed!

**2. Automated Tests:**

- Automated tests were introduced, acting as the guardian angels preventing misconfigurations from sneaking into deployment.

**3. Monitoring for Nginx Server Start Process:**

- We hired a vigilant monitoring guard specifically trained to keep an eye on the Nginx server's morning routine. No sleeping on the job!

**4. Runbook Creation:**

- A comprehensive runbook was crafted â€“ a step-by-step guide for our engineers, ensuring they're armed and ready for any Nginx shenanigans.

## Conclusion:

In the grand carnival of web stacks, our roller coaster of tech woe gave users an unexpected thrill. The mischievous Nginx was tamed, and measures are in place to ensure our web app stays on the tracks. Join us on this wild ride through the tech jungle, where misconfigurations are the only wild beasts we fear! ðŸš€âœ¨
